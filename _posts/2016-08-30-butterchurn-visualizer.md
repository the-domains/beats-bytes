# I loves me some vizuals

I think being a visually oriented person, i'm just as happy watching as i am listening. In a performance sense, it's twice as engaging to have sight as well as sound. Butterchurn is a reimplementation of Milkdrop as a browser based visual generator.

Butterchurn includes a number (80+) of Milkdrop presets, can play a Soundcloud set or use the local device microphone to trigger changes and transforms.

It comes with all the benefits of a cloud based app, namely, it's available wherever you can get internet and a browser; you can fullscreen the browser for chromeless operation and it's easy to setup. Juts surf to https://butterchurnviz.com and you're good to go.

Given a projector, a good song set and a skilled DJ, you can keep the crowd motivated for hours.

And you can turn off all the chrome, just use the left and right arrows to change presets...

And for the hardcore Viz hacker, the developer has thoughfully provided a profile and preset editor so you can call up your favs when the mood strikes.
