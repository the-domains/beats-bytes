# And then we began again

We're getting the studio up again.

It's been a few years, and there's bit a fair bit of upheaval in our respective lives.

We're coming at this from two different directions. I'm all digital, he's all analog.

So far we've got a couple of old synths, a sampler, mixer and computer based sequencer.

I'm using Reason, VirtualDJ and anything else I can cobble together on a variety of laptops.

We're still discovering what we can do, what we want to do and where we want to go.

We've got time, enthusiasm and a common love of music to propel us forward.

For those about to rock, we salute you.
